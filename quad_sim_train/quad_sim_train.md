# TRAINING OUR QUADRUPED FOR BASIC WALKING 

Now, after learning some of the basics of RL, let us proceed with how to use RL to train our Quadruped robot. Starting with a very basic example, lets consider to train our robot for satisfying the following objectives:
* Linear velocity only in one direction() = 10 m/s
* No trotting

These are the very two basic cases we will implement initially, and then add more conditions for example maintaining the Torso at some height, some acceleration, gaiting, etc.

For instance, we will be using the A1 Quadruped.
